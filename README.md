# Nitro Generator

This is a simple script made using Javascript (node.js), that generates random id strings and checks them using the Discord API if its valid. This project was made for education purposes and will not be used by me.

### How to use this project

1. Download the project/file.
2. You have to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) downloaded on your system.
3. Create a `.env` file and add the following value: `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URI`. And thats the Discord Weebhook URL you need to add.
4. Install the dependencies, using the command: `npm install`
5. Run the file: `node main.js`

**And you are all set...!**

As i said this project was made for education purposes, and you are using it on your own risk. I will not have anything to do if you are getting banned from Discord, is that clear?
